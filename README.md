### Hi there!
I am Benir from Kenya. I am currently a Computer Science Student in Strathmore University. I enjoy learning programming languages as they enhance my strategic thinking skills.
I am currently learning Java, specifically the Springboot framework alongside Object Oriented Programming.
I also make youtube videos on Java and C++. You can find my youtube channel at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzOE7EESaghB9FL_aPU9E_w/
